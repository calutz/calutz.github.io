            <p>Welcome to HTML Assignment 1 by Carson Lutz!</p>

            <details>

                <p>There's really nothing special here. Just using new kinds of code!</p>
            </details>

            <p>Lets start off with a question.</p>

           <p><q>What is the meaning of life?</q></p> 

           <p> Well according to Arnold Schwarznegger, <blockquote>"The meaning of life is not simply to exist, to survive, but to move ahead, to go up, to achieve, to conquer."</blockquote> </p>

            <p>This quote comes from an article titled <cite>The Meaning of Life in 15 Quotes</cite> </p>

            <p>These quotes have some very <i>interesting</i> connotations.</p>

            <!--Here I just used a link to the same website that the link appears on. I did this so I did not accidentally link to something untrustworthy.-->

            <a href="https://calutz.github.io/">Visit my website!</a>

            </div>

            <div>

            <p>Here is a list of random objects.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Apple</li>
                <li>Keyboard</li>
                <li>Shoe</li>
                <li>Tire</li>
            </ul>

            These are my favorite colors in order.

            <ol>
                <li>Blue</li>
                <li>Yellow</li>
                <li>Pink</li>
                <li>Black</li>
            </ol>

            </div>

            <footer>I don't really know what to put here.</footer>
