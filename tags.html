                Just a little bit about me, I love the outdoors! I love doing any kind of sport or activity outdoors such as skiing, hiking, or fly-fishing. Recently I have been trying to merge this love for the outdoors with my other hobbies such as photography and videography. This has been a really fun way to learn these things better and to continue doing the things I love.

                This love for the outdoors has led me to so many cool places! The pictures on this page were taken on the Kenai River in Alaska. I have been lucky enough to experience so much natrue and use the inspiration I get out there for everything else in my life, even web design! I am very excited to continue exploring more of the world that is out there and to implement everything that I have learned when I do.
