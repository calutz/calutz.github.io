                My journey through Web Design and CSS started this semester in Media Production 303. 
                This is a class for web design and focused on how to use HTML, CSS, Wordpress, and 
                Squarespace. After engaging with all of these different elements of web design I feel 
                much more comfortable with web design. I already had prior coding experience from my 
                time in Computer Science, but had never used HTML or CSS before. The prior coding 
                experience definitley gave me an advantage as far as learning the basics of these 
                languages as they were not entirely different from the languages I have used previously. 
                Web Design can be a very fun an creative outlet once you understand it and I look forward 
                to getting to this point more and more as I continue to progress. Web design is already 
                pretty fun and interesting to me, but I am sure I will enjoy it even more as I become 
                better at it. There are so many practical uses for web design that I am very eager to 
                explore sush as portfolio websites, business websites, personal blogs, etc. I hope to 
                become more percise in my use of CSS specifically. This is the one that was a little more 
                different from what I was used to coding in and presented a nice challenge. I plan on
                learning the language better by continuing to practice with CSS in future classes as well
                as on personal projects. I will continue to improve at coding in HTML in this way as well.
                As I mentioned before, we also used Wordpress and Squarespace. My time spent with Wordpress
                showed me how easy it can be to design a nice looking website using premade tools. At first
                I found it a little challenging to navigate the website and its tools, however, once I got
                the hang of it I really enjoyed it. I plan to continue using the Wordpress site I created in
                this class as my personal portfolio website. As I continue to work on this site I hope to
                improve at using website builders. The other website builder we used in this class was Squarespace.
                I did not enjoy using Squarespace as much as Wordpress. It felt clunky and a bit outdated. I also
                felt that you could not get a great experience out of it without paying for the premium services
                which is not something I found with Wordpress. My biggest challenge with Squarespace was definitley
                the formating of the website. Once I got past this, I felt like I was able to put together a pretty
                decent looking website. I do not plan to use Squarespace much in the future, however. I would like 
                to become better versed in all of these aspects of building a website in order to achieve more 
                complete and professional looking websites. Overall, I really enjoy web design and I am glad I took 
                steps to engage with it.
