                Here I will be presenting some of my works from this class. The two main projects I would
                like to show off are the Wordpress and Squarespace websites. These were two of my favorite
                assignments from this class and the two I am most proud of the final product!

                The first website I would like to show off is the Squarespace site. I did this one on my
                father's business and it was a fun challenge to see if I could come up with something unique
                for a business that I have been involved with for a long time. I had plenty of inspiration
                as I have been around the company's opporations for years and in fact took many of the pictures
                used in the website myself. Below is a YouTube video quickly scrolling through the website.

                The second website I would like to present here is the Wordpress website we did this semester.
                This was by far my favorite project from this class. I felt like the Wordpress tools just made
                things really easy and enjoyable. This website was made as a portfolio website for myself and 
                is something that I plan to continue using. I want to update the site further and continue doing
                so as my portfolio grows. I plan to use this site in the future for things such as job interviews.
